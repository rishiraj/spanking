To use the üçëüëã `VectorDB` class and access its functionality through a beautiful UI, follow these steps:

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishiraj/spanking.git
cd spanking
```

## Running the UI

To manage your vector database through an intuitive web interface, you can run the provided `app.py` script:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a local web server. You can then access the UI by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

### Features of the UI

- **Add New Texts:** Easily add texts to your vector database through the interface.
- **View and Manage Texts:** See all stored texts, update them, or delete them with a single click.
- **Search Functionality:** Perform text or image-based searches within your database and view the results directly in your browser.
- **Save and Load Database:** Save your database to a file or load it from a previously saved state with ease.

## Using the üçëüëã `VectorDB` Class Programmatically

If you prefer working with code, you can interact with the `VectorDB` class directly. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Create an Instance:**

    ```python
    from spanking import VectorDB
    vector_db = VectorDB(model_name='BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')
    ```

    You can optionally specify a different pre-trained sentence transformer model by passing its name to the constructor.

2. **Add Texts:**

    ```python
    texts = ["i eat pizza", "i play chess", "i drive bus"]
    vector_db.add_texts(texts)
    ```

    This will encode the texts into embeddings and store them in the database.

3. **Search for Similar Texts or Images:**

    ```python
    text_query = "we play football"
    text_results = vector_db.search(text_query, top_k=2, type='text')
    print("Text search results:")
    for text, similarity in text_results:
        print(f"Text: {text}, Similarity: {similarity}")

    image_url = "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    image_results = vector_db.search(image_url, top_k=2, type='image')
    print("\nImage search results:")
    for text, similarity in image_results:
        print(f"Text: {text}, Similarity: {similarity}")
    ```

    This will retrieve the top-2 most similar texts or images to the query based on cosine similarity. The `search` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the text and its similarity score. You can specify the search type using the `type` parameter (`'text'` for text search and `'image'` for image search).

4. **Delete a Text:**

    ```python
    index = 1
    vector_db.delete_text(index)
    ```

    This will remove the text and its corresponding embedding at the specified index.

5. **Update a Text:**

    ```python
    index = 0
    new_text = "i enjoy eating pizza"
    vector_db.update_text(index, new_text)
    ```

    This will update the text and its corresponding embedding at the specified index with the new text.

6. **Save the Database:**

    ```python
    vector_db.save('vector_db.pkl')
    ```

    This will save the current state of the `VectorDB` instance to a file named 'vector_db.pkl'.

7. **Load the Database:**

    ```python
    vector_db = VectorDB.load('vector_db.pkl')
    ```

    This will load the `VectorDB` instance from the file named 'vector_db.pkl' and return it.

8. **Convert to DataFrame:**

    ```python
    df = vector_db.to_df()
    ```

    This will convert the current state of the `VectorDB` instance to a Pandas Dataframe.

9. **Iterate Over Stored Texts:**

    ```python
    for text in vector_db:
        print(text)
    ```

10. **Access Individual Texts by Index:**

    ```python
    index = 2
    text = vector_db[index]
    print(text)
    ```

11. **Get the Number of Texts:**

    ```python
    num_texts = len(vector_db)
    print(num_texts)
    ```

## Example Usage

Here's an example to demonstrate how you can use the üçëüëã `VectorDB` class:

```python
from spanking import VectorDB
vector_db = VectorDB()

# Add texts to the database
texts = ["i eat pizza", "i play chess", "i drive bus"]
vector_db.add_texts(texts)

# Search for similar texts
query = "we play football"
top_results = vector_db.search(query, top_k=2)
print("Top results:")
for text, similarity in top_results:
    print(f"Text: {text}, Similarity: {similarity}")

# Update a text
vector_db.update_text(1, "i enjoy playing chess")

# Delete a text
vector_db.delete_text(2)

# Save the database
vector_db.save('vector_db.pkl')

# Load the database
loaded_vector_db = VectorDB.load('vector_db.pkl')

# Iterate over the stored texts in the loaded database
print("\nStored texts in the loaded database:")
for text in loaded_vector_db:
    print(text)

# Convert to dataframe
df = loaded_vector_db.to_df()
print(df.head())
```

This example demonstrates how to create a üçëüëã `VectorDB` instance, add texts, search for similar texts, update and delete texts, and iterate over the stored texts.
